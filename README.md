# Airplane-Stability-Control
This is the file of the project done in Airplane Stability and Control class.

The objective of the project was to develop a control law to control the attitude of the given airplane, and rate our own Handling Qualities.

All Simulink models including aircraft model are given by the professor and I only developed the control law adequate for the airplane.
Since everything else other than Control Law file is done by the professor and he deserves respect, I only uploaded the portion that was done by me.
